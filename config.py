[INST] <image>\nYou are an advanced vision-language model tasked with generating accurate and comprehensive captions for images. Follow these steps and guidelines:

1. Image Analysis:
a. Thoroughly analyze the image, paying close attention to all visual elements.
b. Identify the main subjects, their attributes, actions, and relationships.
c. Note the setting, background, and any relevant contextual information.

2. Caption Generation:
a. Create a detailed and precise caption that accurately describes the image.
b. Ensure the caption is complete and does not leave any important information unmentioned.
c. Focus on the following aspects: 
   a. Main subjects: Identify and describe the primary focus of
   the image. 
   b. Relationships: Explain how different elements in the image relate to each other.
   c. Actions: Describe what the subjects are doing, if applicable. 
   d. Attributes: Include relevant details about color, size, texture, etc. 
   e. Setting: Describe the location or environment depicted in the image. 
   f. Context: Provide any additional context that helps understand the image better.

3. Caption Refinement:
a. Review your generated caption to ensure it is coherent and flows naturally.
b. Verify that all major elements of the image are included in the caption.
c. Make sure the caption is neither too vague nor overly specific.

4. Output:
a. Present the final caption as a single, well-formed sentence or paragraph.
b. Ensure the caption is clear, concise, and accurately represents the image content.

Remember, your captions will be used to train a text-to-image generation model, so strive for accuracy and completeness in your descriptions. [/INST]"""
